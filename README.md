# Music Production Guide

## Hardware
[This guide](https://ehomerecordingstudio.com) will show you all the hardware you'll need for each step of being a producer, from "bedroom" studio to "pro" studio, along with recommendations.

## Software

### Essential Tools
- A DAW (digital audio workstation). There is no correct DAW to use. These all have different workflows, each with their own pros and cons, so download the free demos and choose what you like the most.
  - My personal favorites (I mainly use the top two): 
    - [REAPER](https://reaper.fm) (Mac, Windows, Linux) - My go-to for mixing, mastering, and recording. Very cheap ($60), but just as powerful as any of the others. It's also the most customizable/scriptable DAW (you can create keyboard macros and scripts for just about everything, and you can even code your own audio processing plugins!) Currently I use both this and Bitwig, but I might switch to just REAPER in the future if I can set everything up the way I like it.
      - Part of the cheap price comes from the fact that, unlike the others listed here, REAPER doesn't come with many high-quality plugins (which you'll need for mixing and mastering). _However_, the other essential tools listed here (Komplete Start and iZotope Neutron/Ozone) will make up for this.
    - [Bitwig Studio](https://www.bitwig.com/) (Mac, Windows, Linux) - Currently what I use for jamming and sound design. Use this if you're into making your own sounds. It comes with a [modular patching environment called The Grid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wHHbV8Zw4g), which is more intuitive and fun to use than all of the comparable tools out there.
    - [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com) (Mac, Windows) - Like Bitwig, excellent for sound design and live performance. Extremely popular with electronic musicians, both professionals and hobbyists. Where it exceeds Bitwig: its collection of high-quality, professional-sounding synths, effects, and samples (over 70 GB!) Where it lags behind Bitwig: it's more expensive, doesn't have Linux support, and its modular patching environment (Max for Live) is much more daunting.
  - Some others you may want to consider:
    - [Pro Tools](https://www.avid.com/pro-tools) (Mac, Windows) - Industry standard. **Only use this (or at least learn _how_ to use it) if you plan to work in a professional studio. Otherwise, don't bother.**
    - [Logic Pro](https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/) (Mac only) - Haven't used it, but supposedly it comes with lots of cool plugins and an intuitive workflow, and I know professionals who use it daily. At $200, it might be the best bang for your buck if you're a Mac owner. 
    - [Studio One](https://www.presonus.com/products/Studio-One) (Mac, Windows) - Haven't used this either, but a lot of people seem to like it. You can [rent-to-own](https://splice.com/daws/38892279-studio-one-5-professional-by-presonus) it for $17/mo. [This Sweetwater video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59uMKF7v4ug) explains some of its unique features (btw, REAPER also has support for musical notation).
    - [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com) (Mac, Windows) - Popular with electronic and hip hop musicians. LIFETIME free upgrades at a cheap one-time price, which no other DAW on this list currently offers, a promise they've kept for over 20 years. I started out with this, but ended up liking Bitwig, Ableton, and Reaper a lot more.
    - [Cakewalk](https://www.bandlab.com/products/cakewalk) (Windows only) - Free DAW. Tried it a while ago and didn't care much for it, but some people seem to like it. Try it out, but don't let price be the sole determining factor.
  - In addition, when it comes to electronic composition and sound design (NOT mixing and mastering), some people prefer to use a "DAW-less" setup. This could involve using hardware sequencers/synths/drum machines, coding environments like Super Collider, virtual modular environments like VCV Rack, or a combination of all of the above. Don't spend your time on this if you're just starting out, but take note for future reference that these tools exist.
- Free virtual instruments and guitar amps: [Komplete Start](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/bundles/komplete-start/) by Native Instruments
  - Comes with the [Guitar Rig 6 Player](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/guitar/guitar-rig-6-player/) virtual amp software, some drum kits (in the Kontakt Factory Selection), and [much more](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/bundles/komplete-start/included-products/).
- A mixing/mastering plugin suite: iZotope [Neutron](https://www.izotope.com/en/products/neutron.html) and [Ozone](https://www.izotope.com/en/products/ozone.html) Standard (includes EQ, compressor, exciter, transient shaper, and more)
  - If you can only afford one, get Neutron. You won't need Ozone until you're ready to master, in other words putting final touches on your audio for publishing.
  - If you're using Ableton Live, just start with the built-in mixing/mastering plugins, as those are very high quality. 
  - Neutron + Ozone:
    - [One-time purchase: $500](https://www.pluginboutique.com/product/2-Effects/39-FX-Bundle/7514-Mix-Master-Bundle)
    - [Rent-to-own: $15/mo for 25 months](https://splice.com/plugins/38765945-ozone-9-neutron-3-standard-vst-by-izotope)
    - Or, join the [iZotope Producers Club](https://www.izotope.com/en/shop/producers-club-monthly.html) for $20/mo which includes both of these and much more, and will give you the latest upgrades going forward. The downside is that you never get to "own" the plugins. Once you stop paying, they stop working.
  - Neutron:
    - [One-time purchase: $250](https://www.pluginboutique.com/products/5411)
    - [Rent-to-own: $10/mo for 25 months](https://splice.com/plugins/38728958-neutron-3-standard-vst-au-by-izotope)

### Other Great Plugins
- [Trash 2](https://www.pluginboutique.com/products/438-Trash2) by iZotope (AMAZING distortion plugin, **not free** but often on sale)
- [EZDrummer](https://www.toontrack.com/product/ezdrummer-2/) by Toontrack (high-quality acoustic drum instrument, **not free**)
  - Komplete Start comes with a few drum kits for free, so try those out before spending money on this.
- [Serum](#more-info-on-synthesizers) by Xfer Records (synthesizer, **not free** but has a nice rent-to-own plan. Lots of quality presets online)
- [Vital](#more-info-on-synthesizers) by Matt Tytel (synthesizer, **free**. Much newer, so not as many presets available)
- [Stochas](https://stochas.org) by Surge Synth Team (sequencer, **free**)
  - Reaper doesn't come with a live performance sequencer like Ableton and Bitwig do, so this is a good alternative.
- [Sononym](https://www.sononym.net) (AI-powered sample browser, **not free**. Incredibly powerful for analyzing and organizing sounds)

### Useful Tools
- [Youtube-dl-gui](https://github.com/MrS0m30n3/youtube-dl-gui) (download backing tracks, samples, and other audio from YouTube)
- [All8 Tap BPM](https://www.all8.com/tools/bpm.htm) (can detect BPM by tapping the keyboard)

## More info on synthesizers
Synths are a great way to add flair to your songs, even if you aren't making solely electronic music. A synth plugin lets you generate your own sounds, including leads, basses, percussion, strings, pads, and more. I recommend using either [Serum](https://xferrecords.com/products/serum) or [Vital](https://vital.audio). Depending on your needs, you may only need _one_ synth for the rest of your career, as both of these are incredibly powerful and can create almost any sound. They both come with many sounds (also known as "presets", or "patches"), but you can also download them from the internet, tweak the ones you have, or create your own from scratch.

My recommendation:
- If you're willing to spend a little extra ($10/month) and want the ability to download lots of high-quality presets, go with Serum. 
- If you don't care as much about presets, want to learn sound design, want to support open source, or just like things that are **FREE**, go with Vital. Vital also has Linux support and stores its patches in JSON format, which is awesome if you're a programmer.

### Vital
- [Download](https://vital.audio) (requires signup, which is annoying but free)
  - You can also pay $80 for the Pro edition which comes with some great experimental sounds. All of the features are the same either way.
- [Full YouTube tutorial by In the Mix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qQX6YGBQEA)
- [Discord server](https://discord.gg/dpZxr98) where people share presets, tips and tricks

Also recommended: [Signalizer](http://www.jthorborg.com/index.html?ipage=signalizer) is an oscilloscope plugin (also includes a spectrum analyzer and vector scope), which is invaluable for analyzing your synth patches and effects in realtime.

## Where to find samples
