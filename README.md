# Music Production Guide

## Essential Tools
- [REAPER](https://reaper.fm)
- [Komplete Start](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/bundles/komplete-start/) (free suite of plugins)
  - Comes with the [Guitar Rig 6 Player](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/guitar/guitar-rig-6-player/) virtual amp software.
- [iZotope Neutron](https://www.izotope.com/en/products/neutron.html) (all-in-one EQ, compressor, exciter, transient shaper, and more)

## Other Great Plugins
- [iZotope Trash 2](https://www.pluginboutique.com/products/438-Trash2) (AMAZING distortion plugin, not free but often on sale)
- [EZDrummer](https://www.toontrack.com/product/ezdrummer-2/) (high-quality acoustic drum instrument, not free)
- [Serum](https://xferrecords.com/products/serum) (synthesizer, not free. Lots of quality presets online)
- [Vital](https://vital.audio) (synthesizer, free. Much newer, so not as many presets available)
- [Stochas](https://stochas.org) (sequencer, free)
  - Reaper doesn't come with a live performance sequencer like Ableton and FL Studio do, so this is a good alternative.
- [Youtube-dl-gui](https://github.com/MrS0m30n3/youtube-dl-gui) (not a plugin, but useful for downloading backing tracks, samples, and other audio from YouTube)
